# Graphics Intercept and Trace Solution (GITS)

**Graphics Intercept and Trace Solution** (**GITS**) is an opensource capture-replay tool by [Intel](https://www.intel.com) for  

- [Vulkan :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://vulkan.org/)
- [OpenCL :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)
- [Intel oneAPI Level Zero :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://spec.oneapi.io/level-zero/latest/core/INTRO.html)
- [OpenGL :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/) and 
- [DirectX12 :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d12/direct3d-12-graphics)

**GITS** allows you to record sequences of API calls into binary traces that can be replayed later (we call them '*streams*'). See the [Usage section](#usage) for more info.

#### Target audience

**GITS** is a collection of *command line tools* which has been used for years to help develop and validate *Intel GPU drivers*, but we think it can be useful to other users as well. 

*Please note: if you are a game developer who wants to analyze frames using a graphical tool, [GPA](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/graphics-performance-analyzers/overview.html) or a similar tool is what you should look at.*

## Install & Building

Currently we do not provide prebuilt binaries, so you have to [build it yourself](building.md). **GITS** is written in C++ so you will need a *compiler*, a *build system* and *Python 3*. 

## Usage

To **record an application**, you will have to inject our dynamic library (called '*the interceptor*') into it. On *Windows*, this is typically done by copying a DLL into the app directory. On *Linux*, by manipulating loader environment variables. When recording *Vulkan*, it is also possible to use **GITS** as a *Vulkan layer* instead.

To **replay a stream**, pass it as an argument to the **gitsPlayer**-executable. 

We provide a general introduction to [using GITS](usage.md) as well as more detailed information, that can be found in the [documentation](documentation/terminology.md) and/or the [userguides](guides/userguide.md) section.
